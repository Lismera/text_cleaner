The Visible World 
By Jorie Graham 
I dig my hands into the absolute. The surface
                                                                 breaks
into shingled, grassed clusters; lifts.
If I press, pick-in with fingers, pluck,
I can unfold the loam. It is tender. It is a tender
maneuver, hands making and unmaking promises.
Diggers, forgetters. . ....
